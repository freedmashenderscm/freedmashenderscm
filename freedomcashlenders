Most payday loans are for recurring expenses, such as rent or utilities. About 80% of payday loans are renewed or quickly reborrowed. This is because the single, lump-sum payment takes a third of a typical borrower’s next paycheck and a new loan covers the gap created by the prior loan. All payday loan customers have a checking account—lenders require it—and about 8 in 10 said in a survey that they would borrow from their bank if it were possible. Yet until recently, overdraft was virtually the only alternative their banks offered. There is evidence that a third of overdrafters use it intentionally to borrow money.
