As wage garnishment and abusive collection practices spread, state lawmakers sought to create a mainstream consumer credit market from state-licensed lenders. The Uniform Small Loan Law, guidance for states published in 1916, permitted 42% annualized interest on loans of up to $300 (equivalent to more than $8,000 today). Two-thirds of states adopted some form of the law.

As the century progressed, larger consumer loans from banks and credit unions became commonplace for borrowers with strong credit histories, but small loans to customers with limited or weak credit histories remained rare. Federally chartered banks and credit unions have long enjoyed exemptions from state laws, so they were not governed by the Uniform Small Loan Law or other state-level consumer protections. Federal law can provide meaningful alternative protections, but two important gaps emerged in the market for small-dollar credit.
